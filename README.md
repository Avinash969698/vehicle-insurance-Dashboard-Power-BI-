🚗 Vehicle Insurance Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

I recently created this interactive Vehicle Insurance Dashboard using Power BI to analyze customer demographics, vehicle conditions, and premium patterns.

🔍 Key Insights:
• Vehicle Damage: Clear comparison of customers with/without previous vehicle damage.
• Gender Distribution: Visual breakdown of policyholders by gender.
• Annual Premium Trend: How annual premiums vary across different age groups.
• Sales Channel & Premium: Relationship between age, annual premium, and policy sales channels.
• Vehicle Age: Donut chart showing the distribution of vehicles by age categories.

📊 This dashboard helps understand customer behavior, premium trends, and risk segments, which can support decision-making in the insurance sector.
